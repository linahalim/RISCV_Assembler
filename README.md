# RISCV_Assembler
Mini assembler for RISC-V code

The goal was to build a mini assembler for RISC-V code in python. The assembler accepts an input file that gives the assembly code and produces as an output the machine code (written in hexadecimal text). The assembly code may include comments.The instructions the assembler is able to assemble include: ADD, ADDI, SLL, SLLI, SRL, SRLI, XOR, ADDI, ORI, ANDI, MUL, BEQ, BNE. The assembler recognizes instruction in a case insensitive manner.
